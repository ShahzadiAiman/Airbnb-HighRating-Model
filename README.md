Predicting high ratings for Airbnb listings using logistic regression

# Airbnb High Rating Model

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether an Airbnb listing is likely to receive a high rating based on various listing features. The model was built as part of the Break Through Tech AI program.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict whether a listing will receive a high rating.
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - One-hot encoding of categorical features
  - Handling missing values and outliers (via Winsorization)
  - Feature scaling for model compatibility
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Cross-validation to validate performance

## Dataset

The dataset was provided by the program organizers.

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** 82.9%
- **Precision:** 82.9%
- **Recall:** 99.9%

> Logistic regression performed well in identifying listings with high ratings, with excellent recall, indicating strong sensitivity to positive cases.
